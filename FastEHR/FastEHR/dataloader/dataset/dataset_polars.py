        """
        Creates a deep-learning-friendly dataset by extracting structured data from an SQLite database.

        This function loads information from SQLite tables into Polars frames in chunks and processes them
        into a format suitable for deep learning models. The processing includes:

        - Loading SQLite data into Polars frames.
        - Combining and aligning frames into a lazy Polars representation.
        - Iteratively computing normalization statistics, counts, or other meta-information.
        - Saving Polars frames to Parquet format.
        - Creating a hashmap dictionary for fast lookups (faster than native PyArrow solutions).
        - Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.

        Parameters
        ----------
        path : str
            Full path to the folder where the Parquet dataset, meta-information, and file lookup pickles will be stored.

        practice_inclusion_conditions : list[str], optional
            A list of SQL conditions to filter practices when querying the collector.
            Example: `["COUNTRY = 'E'"]` to include only practices from England.

        include_static : bool, optional, default=True
            Whether to include static information in the meta-information.

        include_diagnoses : bool, optional, default=True
            Whether to include diagnoses in the meta-information and the Parquet dataset.

        include_measurements : bool, optional, default=True
            Whether to include measurements in the meta-information and the Parquet dataset.

        overwrite_practice_ids : str, optional, default=False
            The path for the file containing practice ID allocations for train/test/validation splits.
            This is useful for aligning datasets, for example, when creating a fine-tuning dataset from a Foundation
            Model dataset to prevent data leakage.

        overwrite_meta_information : str, optional
            If provided, this should be a path to an existing meta-information pickle file.
            This allows skipping redundant pre-processing when using precomputed quantile bounds for some measurements.


        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        drop_empty_dynamic : bool, default=True
            Whether to remove patients with no recorded dynamic events.

        drop_missing_data : bool, default=True
            Whether to remove records with missing data.

        Notes
        -----
        - The SQLite collector **cannot be pickled**, so the class attributes are saved separately.
        - Future work should aim to pickle this class instead of storing separate attributes.
