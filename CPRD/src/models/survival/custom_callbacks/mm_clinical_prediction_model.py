            outcome_token_to_desurv_output_index:
                              A dictionary hash map where keys are the outcome tokens of interest, and the values are the index of the DeSurv 
                                output index they belong to. 
                              In the pre-training (self-supervised/causal) and few-shot (supervised with unmodified architecture) cases,
                                the map is from outcome to one of `vocab_size` indices, as the DeSurv heads (in both SR and CR) predict
                                the risk of every token.
                              In the fine-tuning (supervised) case, the DeSurv head is replaced with one that only predicts the relevant 
                                outcomes. In the Single-Risk case, this gives a many-to-1 map, combining all the outcomes into a single-risk 
                                and so every token included in this umbrella maps to the zero-index (as there is only one predicted survival 
                                curve). In the Competing-Risk case, each will map 1-to-1 to the K considered competing-risk outcome indicies.
                                
        KWARGS:
            custom_stratification_method:
                             A function which takes as an argument the batch, and returns a stratification label
                             For example, if we want to stratify by gender then the batch dictionary will be inputted, and the return will be a list 
                             of length equal to the number of samples, of the form ["male", "female", "male",...] etc. and the unique strings will be used
                             to stratify the RMST logging.
            log_individual:   Whether or not to log for the individual outcome CIFs/CDFs. 
                                For few-shot single-risk, this is the only appropriate choice. For few-shot competing-risk this may highlight which 
                                outcomes the model is better able to predict.
                                For fine-tune single risk, there is only one outcome CIF/CDF and so this is not appropriate.
                              Note:  
                                If there are low prevalence outcome tokens then there are likeliy to be batches with no individuals  
                                experiencing that outcome, leading to warnings. In this case, the batch's metric for that individual 
                                CIF will not be logged which may bias the aggregated reported values.
            log_combined:     Whether or not to log the marginal CIFs/CDFs. 
                                This is only an appropriate choice for the Competing Risk case. In the SR setting, this will raise an
                                exception.
